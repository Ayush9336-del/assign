Program Output Explanation


1  ->  In function first it will look for the variable x which is not present in the first function so it will find the x in global scope then print x = 5 


same for the second function it will look for the y in lexical scope that is in first function  y = 10 


for the z that is defined as let z = 20 but till line 3 it is not  delcared so it will give undefined


for the last one it will thorw reference error because for the var it has function level scope and we are tyring to access it out of the function  y in not defined



2 -> 

JavaScript knows z exists, but doesn't know its value yet.
So it prints undefined.

3-> 

it wil try to find the  y  in the same function as it is not there so will check the first function and prints it 


4-> 
y lives inside first(), so outside it, y does not exist because var has function level scope 


5->

let x = 5;

function first() {
  console.log(x); // Line 1  --> 5 
  let y = 10;

  function second() {
    console.log(y); // Line 2   --> 10 
    console.log(z); // Line 3   --> reference error 
    let z = 20;
  }

  second();
}

first();
console.log(y); // Line 4       



for the line 1 and 2 the output is 5  and 10  but for the line 3 it will show reference error because of let it can't access the variable z then it will not go for the  line 4 in var  y
